#### TODO

- Write more custom aliases and include them in their own .md or in here.
- Fix install script so that it works across MacOS, Arch & Debian systems
- Investigate GNU Stow for managing this repo
- Move from `vim-test` to [neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest)
- Remap keyboard so held caps lock acts as ctrl (achieved in MacOS with karabiner elements, I should track this as part of config)

#### Things to investigate

- [diagflow.nvim](https://github.com/dgagn/diagflow.nvim) for showing diagnostics in top-right

#### Other misc info

- Wezterm requires MesloLGS fonts from powerlevel10k
- In Windows, Neovim files go in C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\nvim. Update settings.vim path in vim init.lua
